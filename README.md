### `Geting Value from 2 API's`

Having fetched a list of services [1] and providers [2] from the API, create an interface that has two sections:
•	A 'control' section which displays each service. 
•	A 'results' section which displays all provider names. 

Then:
•	If a service name is clicked, that service gets highlighted, and 
•	Only providers associated with that service gets shown in the 'results' section.
